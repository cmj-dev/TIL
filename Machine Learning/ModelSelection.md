# Model Selection and Regularization

If there are many perdictors, we have to select or regularize predictors for two purpose

### 1. For higher prediction accuracy
Let's assume that there is *N* number of observations and *P* number of predictors.

If $ P \approx N $, the model will be overfitted and if $ N < P $, there will be no unique solution for model.

So we have reduce number of predictors.

### 2. For better interpretability
In real world, some predictors will be just a noise.

By reduce the number of predictor, we could get better interpretability.
